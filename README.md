#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves various processes such as design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of Programming Languages (1950s–1960s)

Introduction of languages like Fortran and C, which improved software development efficiency.

2. Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s)

Software engineering was recognized as a distinct field to address the increasing complexity of software systems.

3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s-Present)
   
The Agile Manifesto introduced flexible and iterative approaches to software development, enhancing collaboration and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements – Gathering and documenting system and user needs.
Design – Creating high-level and detailed system architecture.
Implementation – Writing and developing the actual software.
Testing – Ensuring functionality and software quality.
Deployment – Releasing the software for use.
Maintenance – Updating and improving the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology follows a rigid, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it ideal for well-defined projects with stable requirements, such as government contracts. In contrast, Agile embraces an iterative and incremental process that allows continuous adjustments, making it better suited for projects requiring flexibility, such as mobile apps and SaaS products.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes code, implements features, and troubleshoots software issues.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality.
Project Manager – Oversees planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring project goals are met.

Other roles include System Architect (designs system structure) and UI/UX Designer (improves user experience).

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs - Provide debugging, code editing, and testing tools to streamline development.
VCS - Help track changes, manage collaboration, and prevent code conflicts.
Why they matter - Increase productivity, enhance code quality, and streamline teamwork.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers often face changing requirements, which can lead to project scope creep; this can be mitigated by adopting Agile methodologies that allow for continuous iteration. Tight deadlines create pressure that may result in rushed development, but this can be overcome by prioritizing tasks and breaking projects into smaller, manageable sprints. Additionally, technical debt accumulates when shortcuts or inefficient coding practices are used, but it can be managed through frequent code refactoring and adherence to best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing focuses on verifying individual software components in isolation, whereas integration testing ensures that multiple modules interact correctly. While system testing evaluates the software’s overall functionality as a complete product, acceptance testing determines whether the final product meets user expectations and business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

This is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise

A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Create a digital art piece about culture."

"Design a surreal digital artwork depicting a young Kenyan storyteller surrounded by floating ancestral masks, symbolizing the blending of tradition and modernity. Use warm earthy tones with a futuristic glow to highlight the connection between past and present."

The improved prompt enhances clarity by specifying the subject, a young Kenyan storyteller, making it easier for the artist to visualize the concept. It also adds specificity by defining key elements such as floating ancestral masks and the blending of tradition with modernity, reducing ambiguity. While detailed, it remains concise by focusing on essential artistic aspects without unnecessary complexity. Additionally, it provides clear guidance on style and mood by incorporating surreal elements, earthy tones, and a futuristic glow, ensuring the intended artistic feel is effectively conveyed.
